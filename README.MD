## TO-DO-LIST (PRACTICE)
<hr>
This is a simple To-Do List App where the user enters their task into the text input area and it displays above with a checkbox and delete button on each side.   

# Purpose
<hr>
- Dom manipulation; I've created this to mainly practice appending new elements using Javascript.
